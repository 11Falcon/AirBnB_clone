0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
Description
The AirBnB clone project is a project to build a clone of the AirBnB website, step by step learning the real life implementation of complex websites such as the AirBnB website and developint the necessary skills towards building a full web application. This first step is very important and will be built upon subsequently in following projects such as: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
